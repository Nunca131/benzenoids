  Report for Funding Period 2017}

The project started \TODO{when}. 

Focus of the project in the first funding period was the exploration of
graph classes that play a particular role in cheminformatics. Benzenoids
are 2-connected subgraphs of the hexagonal lattice. The visit of the
Leipzig group to Koper \TODO{when} was used to initiate the systematic
investigation of convexity in benzenoids. Of particular interest in this
context are the graph that violate convexity in an extreme manner. Software
was developed for enumerating small and moderate-size benzenoids to screen
for such graphs. 

\TODO{add a paragraph on the content of the paper.}

A joint manuscript on this topic intend for the mathematical chemistry
journal \emph{MATCH} is in perparation.

Current activities include in particular the construction of publicly
available web service to explore the universe of benzenoid graphs.
